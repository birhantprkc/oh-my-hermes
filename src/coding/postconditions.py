"""Task-linked postconditions: the tests a unit's own changes reach.

A contract unit's declared `verification_commands` say what the operator chose
to check. Nothing ties them to the task: a compile pass and a few modules from
the same package pass whether or not the change is right, and a gate that
re-runs them can never disagree with the executor that already ran them green.

A unit that declares `task_linked_test_runner` adds one postcondition whose
subject is derived from what the unit actually changed, not from what anyone
wrote down: the dispatcher reads the observed diff between the base and the
unit's committed head, walks the local codegraph's recorded import edges
backwards one step, and runs the runner on every test module that directly
imports a changed file (plus any changed test module itself). The command's
exit status is the verdict, recorded like every other dispatcher-observed
check; wording cannot move it.

One step, not the whole reverse closure: on this repository a single core
module's closure reaches most of the suite, which would turn a task-linked
check into a slower full run. A direct importer is a test that names the
changed module, which is the smallest set a static reader can call "the tests
of this change". Everything here is pure: the graph and the changed paths are
passed in, and nothing is imported, executed, or spawned.
