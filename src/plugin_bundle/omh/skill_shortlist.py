"""Name the skills a turn's request may want, from the catalog's own words.

The rule table in `awareness.py` names a workflow only when a message says one
of its cue phrases, and a person who does not know a skill's vocabulary
describes the situation instead ("our week-one retention dropped"). Measured
on a live model, that table named the intended skill for 14% of paraphrased
work requests, while a BM25 ranking over each skill's name, triggers,
situations, and description held it in its top four for most of them.

This module is that ranking, read from `tools/skill_shortlist.json`, which
`omh docs skill-shortlist` writes from the catalog. The bundle cannot import
`omh` (`tests/test_plugin_bundle_standalone.py`), so the tokenizer below
repeats `omh.routing.localization.routing_terms` and
`omh.routing.lexical_shortlist.lexical_terms` (stemmer included), and every
word list comes from the sidecar. `tests/test_skill_shortlist_sidecar.py` holds the two rankings
equal. A missing or unreadable sidecar ranks nothing, so the turn gets no line.

Only ASCII letter-and-digit words are ranked; every other token is dropped.
A message written wholly in another script therefore gets no line, while a
mixed message (Korean with English product words, say) is ranked on its
ASCII words and can get one.

What reaches the model is one line of candidates, and only when the request
reads as work: see `skill_candidates_for_turn`. The line names skills the
model may load; it selects nothing and loads nothing. It is shown once per
session per candidate set (`claim_candidate_line`).
