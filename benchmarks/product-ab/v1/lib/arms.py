"""The three arms.

* ``hermes``       — Hermes alone: one `hermes --oneshot` attempt, bare task.
* ``omh``          — the same model and effort, reached through OMH's coding
  delegation: the route OMH resolves, the calibration that route selects, the
  delegation prompt discipline, and the verification gate.
* ``omh_mixture``  — the same, except the model comes from the category
  mixture OMH's complexity routing resolves, so the cost number stays
  attributable to routing rather than to calibration.

Every arm runs through the same Hermes execution path, so the only differences
between ``hermes`` and ``omh`` are the ones OMH owns.
